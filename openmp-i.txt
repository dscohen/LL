pragma only applies to the next block

still hard because of coherence and race conditions
  cache coherence at the level right above smallest shared
  layer of memory

coherence almost always is on chip

1 cpu update a block at a time, invalidates other writes,
  doesn't influence block updates

openmp doesn't mean all threads will start at around the same time.
