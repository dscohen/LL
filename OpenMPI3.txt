OpenMPI for loops
*****************

#prgma omp parallel for, if you drop the parallel, openmp will only use currently active threads to ||
  current threads

  openmp runtime decides what value i is for each thread

identity value for
&& : True
||: False
&: 1111111
|:0000000
^:000000000

static is cyclic, assigned before execution

n/threadcount in static scheduling leads to normal scheduling

create threads at outer level
